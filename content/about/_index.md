This blog is a collection of my thoughts on various ideas I’ve found valuable for being happy, improving my life, or understanding the world. See the Top Posts page to get an idea of where to start. 

I blog according to my internal sense of fun and whimsy, and accordingly don’t blog on any fixed schedule. Depending on how busy I am, I will sometimes have bursts of many posts and long breaks in between. You can subscribe to hear about new posts here.

If you have any feedback, positive or negative, to help me become a better writer, I’d really appreciate hearing about it!
